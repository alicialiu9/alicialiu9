### Hi 👋

## About me 👩‍💻
Hi! My name is Alicia Liu, and I am a third-year undergraduate student majoring in Linguistics & Computer Science at UCLA. I’m passionate about the intersection of technology and language, with interests in software development and computational linguistics.

I grew up in Southern California, bilingual in Mandarin and English, which inspired my curiosity about language processing and human-computer interaction. When I’m not coding, you can find me:

- **💃 Dancing**
- **🎤 Singing**
- **📺 Watching dramas**
- **🧑‍🍳 Cooking** 

I’m always eager to learn new skills, tackle challenging projects, and collaborate with others to create meaningful tech solutions.
